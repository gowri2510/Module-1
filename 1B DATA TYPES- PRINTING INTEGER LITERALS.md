# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Printing Integer Literals

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the following integer literals: 123, 456, 789.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Initialize the integer literals `123`, `456`, and `789`.  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the numbers `123`, `456`, and `789`.  
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223060072
# Name-Gowri.M
# Write your code here

num1 = 123
num2 = 456
num3 = 789

print(num1)
print(num2)
print(num3)

```
## OUTPUT
<img width="987" height="323" alt="{9AE69B2A-02F7-4984-88D7-AFBAC6D0A581}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec65cd23-727f-4bd6-a864-ca332b068a08" />

## RESULT
The program was executed successfully. It printed the integer literals 123, 456, and 789 as expected.
